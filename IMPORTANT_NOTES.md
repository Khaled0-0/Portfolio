# Important Notes for Your New Portfolio

## ✅ What's Done

Your portfolio has been completely rebuilt with:
- ✨ Modern Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- 🎨 Beautiful blue sky color theme
- 🌓 Dark/Light mode with smooth transitions
- 🎭 Framer Motion animations throughout
- 📱 Fully responsive design
- 🚀 All your projects and content migrated

## ⚠️ Missing Image

The file `boatingx.png` is missing (shown as deleted in git). You have two options:

### Option 1: Restore the image
```bash
git restore images/boatingx.png
xcopy images\boatingx.png public\images\ /Y
```

### Option 2: Add a new image
Place a new BoatingX screenshot as `public/images/boatingx.png`

### Option 3: Use a temporary placeholder
The app will work without it, but the image won't display for that project. You can update it later.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run development server:**
   ```bash
